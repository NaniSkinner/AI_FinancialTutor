# SpendSense Operator Dashboard

## Your Financial Learning Hub

A modern Next.js application for operators to review and manage AI-generated financial recommendations with real-time monitoring and dark mode support.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Branding & Logo

The SpendSense logo features a modern globe design that represents our global approach to financial education. The logo comes in two variants:

- **Logo Component**: Full logo with globe icon, "SpendSense" text, and "Your Financial Learning Hub" tagline
- **LogoCompact Component**: Compact version with just the globe icon and name for headers

Both components support:

- Multiple sizes (small, medium, large)
- Dark and light mode variants
- Optional tagline display
- Responsive design

The logo is located at `components/Common/Logo.tsx` and can be imported from `@/components/Common/Logo`.
